Part 1: Namespaces and classes

1. Create a namespace called “Core”
2. Create a namespace called “Core.Abstract”
3. Create a class “Device” inside the namespace “Core.Abstract”
4. Implement properties “name”
    1. Implement these properties as getName() and setName() methods

5. Implement properties “serial number” and “location” for the “Device” class
    1. Implement these using the "get" and "set" keywords (e.g. get("location"))

Part 2: Inheritance

1. Create a namespace called “Core.Instances”
2. Create a class “Encoder” inside “Core.Instances” which inhertics
from the “Device” class
3. Create a class “Decoder” inside “Core.Instances” which
inherits from the “Device” class

Part 3: Functions

1. Write a function called “info()" which alerts all enumerable properties of an instance (name, serial number, and location of a device, etc.)

Part 4: UI

1. Create a UI with a textbox and dropdown that let’s you type in a
name and choose a device type to create
2. Display the instantiated Device in a list <ul> that shows the name + device type
3. Create a button “info” next to each device

Part 5: Binding

1. Write a global function called “attach” which will take in an
object, an event as a string, and a function. attach() should call the
function on the object when that object’s event gets fired.

      1. e.g. implement function attach(obj, event, fn) { … }

2. Use the attach function to attach each Device instance to the
“info” button’s onClick event. That is, when onClick is fired, it
should call your info() method on your object.
